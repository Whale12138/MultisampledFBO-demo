# MultisampledFBO-demo
Since the SDK provided by Mali is relatively difficult to run, I am offering a demo version with source code that can be directly executed using Android.bp. You can refer to this method to run the SDK provided by Mali.

As this is a demo application layer, it can run on other GPUs as well.
